LADYBUG is an up to 5-axis motorized digital microscope made from 3D-printed and inexpensive consumer electronics. The original was made super DIY out of Blu-Ray players, breadboard motor drivers, and a raspberry pi, while a followup version is based off a USB microscope duct-taped to a 3D printer run by GCode through a windows machine:

While the original focus of the project was on hardware (building the damn thing out of blu-ray players in the first place), the core functionality that has survived and remained useful is motorized scanning to get huge, high quality micropanoramas out of an otherwise limited imaging device. A scan of a coin-sized object could easily be 500 megapixels with the upper limit theoretically being the size of the build plate and time of the scan.

An unaltered 3D printer can be used for motorized inspection with no scanning, low magnification 2D scanning of relatively flat surfaces, and high magnification 2.5 D scanning that combines stacking and stitching. By adding a fourth motor (for instance, the extruder), 3D rotation and scanning of small objects like insects can be done, and a fifth motor can be added for greater flexibility, too. 

A huge amount of development remains to be done, especially with user interfacing and image processing like 3D model generation. A whole-hearted effort was made to get attention for and fund such an effort with a Kickstarter (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1490222859/ladybug-a-3d-scanning-microscope-for-small-and-huge-things). Any coders or interested users are absolutely welcome to get involved!

Currently, the project is being maintained and occasionally updated by its creator Ahron Wayne (WayneWayneHello), with valuable contributions from Yujie Wang (yuji3w) and Daniel Piotrowski (counterintuitive98).
