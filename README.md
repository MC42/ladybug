LADYBUG is a 4-axis motorized microscope made from 3D-printed and inexpensive consumer electronics.

What does this mean?

It has four axes --- X,Y,Z, and rotational. It is motorized --- Each of these axes is powered by stepper motors, and controlled via arduino or raspberry pi. And unlike a typical 3D scanner, it is also a microscope --- or, rather, it carries a USB microscope along one axis. It works in concert with the other one to three axes to take microscopic pictures of a sample from almost any point of view.

And it is affordable --- LadyBug is 3D printed, and makes use of cheap or free consumer electronics --- it is made mostly out of DVD players!

LadyBug is currently operated with a Raspberry pi, and is capable of 2-axis (XY) scanning of a slide, petri dish, or otherwise flat sample, 3-axis (XYZ) scanning of a coverslip, and 4-axis (XYZR) scanning of a small, 3-dimensional object, like an insect. Yes, it is a 3D scanner, but we see it as a general purpose, motorized macrophotography studio. 

We have our sights on an arduino-controlled version and corresponding printed circuit board, to make the system cheaper, faster, and easier to build and handle.
