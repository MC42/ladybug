LADYBUG is an up to 5-axis motorized microscope made from 3D-printed and inexpensive consumer electronics. The original was made out of Blu-Ray players while followup version is based off a 3D printer:

At the extreme end, the blu-ray version is made out of completely recycled and 3D printed parts and runs on a raspberry pi interfaced with breadboard motor drivers. On the other end, you can duct-tape a USB microscope to your 3D printer and connect it to a windows computer via USB. 

While the original focus of the project was on hardware (building the damn thing out of blu-ray players in the first place), the core functionality that has survived and remained useful is motorized scanning to get huge, high quality micropanoramas out of an otherwise limited imaging device. A scan of a coin-sized object could easily be 500 megapixels with the upper limit theoretically being the size of the build plate and time of the scan.

An unaltered 3D printer can be used for motorized inspection with no scanning, low magnification 2D scanning of relatively flat surfaces, and high magnification 2.5 D scanning that combines stacking and stitching. By adding a fourth motor (for instance, the extruder), 3D rotation and scanning of small objects like insects can be done, and a fifth motor can be added for greater flexibility, too. 

A huge amount of development remains to be done, especially with user interfacing and image processing like 3D model generation. A whole-hearted effort was made to get attention for and fund such an effort with a Kickstarter (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1490222859/ladybug-a-3d-scanning-microscope-for-small-and-huge-things). Any coders or interested users are absolutely welcome to get involved!

Currently, the project is being maintained and occasionally updated by its creator Ahron Wayne (WayneWayneHello), with valuable contributions from Yujie Wang (yuji3w) and Daniel Piotrowski (counterintuitive98).
