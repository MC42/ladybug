LADYBUG is a 4-axis motorized microscope made from 3D-printed and inexpensive consumer electronics.

What does this mean?

It is part microscope --- it carries a USB one around. It has four axes --- X,Y,Z, and rotational. And it is motorized --- Each of these axes is powered by stepper motors, and controlled via arduino or raspberry pi. And lastly, and importantly to us, it is affordable and can incorporate a quite abundant recycled part --- DVD players!

LadyBug is currently operated with a Raspberry pi, and is capable of 2-axis (XY) scanning of a slide, petri dish, or otherwise flat sample, 3-axis (XYZ) scanning of a coverslip, and 4-axis (XYZ, and rotational) scanning of a small, 3-dimensional object, like an insect. It is capable of capturing detail of less than 10 microns --- 3d scanners often advertise a resolution 50 times this!

We have our sights on an arduino-controlled version and corresponding printed circuit board, to make the system cheaper, faster, and easier to build and handle.
